# JJM - Jornal Jota Maria - First Prototype


I decided as a personal challenge to each Rocketseat NLW (Next Level Week) not only to follow what is happening in the videos, but to absorb the visual idea and apply it in a different context, with additions and modifications as needed.

So, instead of following Proffy's idea, I adapted it for a news site for a page that I manage.

This personal challenge does not focus on finishing in a week as it is at NLW, but to boost its own projects.

I think in the future to adapt in a mobile application for practice.

My biggest difficulties in the project were / are the color combination and some responsiveness.
